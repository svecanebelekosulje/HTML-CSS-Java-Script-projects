	  <p>The majority of our challenges are free, yes. We do have some that are premium and<br> require a Pro subscription to access. It will say on each challenge whether they are<br> free or premium, so it's easy to tell the difference.</p>

	 <p>The best (and quickest) way to get help on a challenge is in our Discord server. There are thousands of other developers in there, so it's a great place to ask questions. We even have a dedicated "help" channel! If you haven't joined yet, you can get an invite to our <a href='https://discord.com/invite/UAfh3qzhYb'>Discord server here.</a></p>
